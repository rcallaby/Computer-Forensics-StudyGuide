1. **Open an Issue**: If your contribution is substantial, open an issue to discuss it first.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository to make your changes.
3. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `add-disk-imaging-section`).
4. **Write Tests**: If your code modifies functionality, ensure tests are included.
5. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity. Small, focused changes are easier to review and integrate.
