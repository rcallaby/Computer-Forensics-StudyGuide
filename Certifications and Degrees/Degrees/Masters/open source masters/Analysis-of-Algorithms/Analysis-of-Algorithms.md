# Analysis of Algorithms

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course you will be able to 

1. Compare algorithms using asymptotic notation (Θ, O, Ω).
2. Design efficient solutions with divide‑and‑conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, and graph techniques.
3. Implement and test algorithms in the language of your choice (Python is typical).
4. Analyze correctness and complexity; explain NP‑Complete/NP‑Hard problems.
