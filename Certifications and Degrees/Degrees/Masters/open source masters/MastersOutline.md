# Open Source Masters Degree Program 

Below find a complete curriculum of Boston Universitys Computer Forensics Masters Degree Program. I am using this as an example online course that is my aim to make all of this content completely open soure and free.

## Degree Structure

* **Total Requirement:** 10 courses (40 graduate units) ([Boston University][1], [Boston University][2])
* Students complete either:

  * **MS in Computer Science (CS)** with a **Security** concentration
  * **MS in Computer Information Systems (CIS)** with a **Security** concentration
* **Prerequisites:** Bachelor’s degree plus background in programming, discrete mathematics, and computer systems; if gaps exist, BU will assign prerequisite courses ([met-cybersec.bu.edu][3], [Boston University][2])

---

## Core Requirements

**MS in Computer Science (5 courses / 20 units)** ([Boston University][2])

* MET CS 566 Analysis of Algorithms
* MET CS 575 Operating Systems
* MET CS 662 Computer Language Theory
* MET CS 673 Software Engineering
* MET CS 535 Computer Networks *or* MET CS 579 Database Management

**MS in Computer Information Systems (similar core requirements)** ([Boston University][1], [Boston University][2])

* Includes core plus MET CS 546 Probability & Statistics (if not covered earlier) ([computersciencehero.com][4])

## Electives & Specialization in Forensics

Students choose **five electives (20 units)**. Relevant courses include:

* **MET CS 693 Digital Forensics & Investigations**
* **MET CS 694 Mobile Forensics & Security**
* **MET CS 690 Network and Cloud Security**
* **MET CS 695 Cybersecurity**
  These four are also the required courses for BU’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Forensics (16 units)—all transferable to the full master’s program ([Boston University][5])

Additional electives that support the security/forensics track:

* MET CS 684 Enterprise Cybersecurity Management
* MET CS 674 Database Security
* MET CS 689 Designing & Implementing a Data Warehouse
* MET CS 777 Big Data Analytics
* MET CS 789 Cryptography
* MET CS 787 AI and Cybersecurity
  And others listed in the general electives lists of both CS and CIS programs ([Boston University][2])

## Elective Examples (Digital Forensics Focus)

Here’s a sample path focusing on digital forensics and network security:

| Course Code | Title                               | Units |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ----- |
| CS 693      | Digital Forensics & Investigations  | 4     |
| CS 694      | Mobile Forensics & Security         | 4     |
| CS 690      | Network & Cloud Security            | 4     |
| CS 695      | Cybersecurity                       | 4     |
| CS 684      | Enterprise Cybersecurity Management | 4     |

If pursuing the CIS track, add the required core courses plus electives to round out the full 40 units.

## Thesis Option (Optional)

Eligible students (GPA ≥ 3.7 and completion of at least 7 courses) may pursue a thesis option:

* **MET CS 810/811 Master’s Thesis in Computer Science or CIS (8 units)**
* The thesis replaces two electives, reducing electives needed by \~8 units ([Boston University][6], [Boston University][2], [Boston University][1])

---

## Path via Graduate Certificate

If you begin with the **Digital Forensics Graduate Certificate**, you'll complete:

* CS 625 Business Data Communications & Networks
* CS 693 Digital Forensics & Investigations
* CS 694 Mobile Forensics & Security
* One of CS 690 or CS 695
  Total: 16 units ([Boston University][7], [Boston University][5], [Reddit][8])

After finishing the certificate (with B grade or above), you can transition into the full **MS in CIS** or **MS in CS** and just complete the remaining electives and any core not yet taken, without re-applying ([Boston University][5], [Boston University][9])
