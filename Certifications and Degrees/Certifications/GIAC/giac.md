   - **"The Art of Memory Forensics"** by Michael Hale Ligh, Andrew Case, and others (good for memory and system forensics, complementing disk forensics).

#### 3. **Hands-On Practice:**
   Gaining hands-on experience is crucial to passing the GCFE exam. The use of tools like **Autopsy**, **Sleuth Kit**, **FTK Imager**, **X-Ways Forensics**, and **EnCase** will help you familiarize yourself with real-world forensic processes.

### Free and Open-Source Resources

There are several open-source resources and tools available to supplement your learning:

1. **Autopsy and The Sleuth Kit:**
   These are well-known open-source digital forensics tools. Autopsy provides a user-friendly interface, while The Sleuth Kit allows command-line examination of file systems.

2. **SANS Reading Room:**
   The SANS website offers a wealth of free whitepapers and publications related to digital forensics. These cover a range of topics, including artifact analysis, incident response, and forensic techniques.

3. **Digital Forensics Framework (DFF):**
   An open-source tool for investigating digital evidence, with capabilities for file recovery, artifact analysis, and memory forensics.

4. **Magnet Forensicsâ€™ Axiom Free Tools:**
   Magnet Forensics offers several free utilities for data recovery and investigation, which can be useful in preparing for the GCFE.

5. **Online Labs and CTF Challenges:**
