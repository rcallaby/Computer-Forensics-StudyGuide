# Snort Tutorial Outline  

## 1. Introduction

### Overview of Snort

#### What is Snort?

**Snort** is an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) developed by **Martin Roesch in 1998**, and maintained by **Cisco Systems** since its acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013. Snort is designed to monitor network traffic in real time and analyze it against a set of user-defined rules to detect a variety of network-based attacks and suspicious activities.

Snort operates by performing **packet sniffing and analysis**, identifying patterns of behavior or signatures that match known threats, similar to how antivirus software scans files for malware signatures. It can be configured to operate in three main modes: **sniffer**, **packet logger**, and **network intrusion detection/prevention**.

#### Key Features and Capabilities

* **Protocol analysis and content searching/matching**
  Snort can decode and inspect the payload of packets using pattern matching and protocol analysis to identify anomalies or malicious activity.

* **Flexible rule-based language**
  Snort uses a powerful and customizable ruleset language that allows users to define how packets should be handled, including what to detect and how to respond.

* **Real-time alerting**
  When Snort detects a potential threat, it can generate real-time alerts via syslog, a database, or an alert file.

* **Preprocessor and plugin architecture**
  Snort supports modularity through preprocessors, which allow for advanced traffic inspection (e.g., normalization, protocol decoding) and additional functionality via plugins.

* **Open-source and community-supported**
  Being open-source, Snort is freely available and benefits from a large community of users and developers who contribute rules, documentation, and support.

* **Compatibility with other security tools**
  Snort integrates with tools such as **Barnyard2**, **PulledPork**, and **BASE** for log parsing, rule management, and alert visualization.

### Use Cases for Snort

#### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

In IDS mode, Snort inspects network traffic passively. It analyzes packets against its rule base and logs alerts about potential intrusions without actively interfering with the traffic. This mode is ideal for monitoring and forensic analysis.

Use cases include:

* Detecting known malware signatures in HTTP, DNS, SMTP traffic.
* Identifying port scans, OS fingerprinting attempts, and brute-force login attempts.
* Monitoring insider threats or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

When configured as an IPS, Snort is deployed **inline** (i.e., in the path of network traffic) and can actively drop malicious packets in real time. This transforms Snort from a passive monitor into an active defense tool.

Use cases include:

* Blocking exploit attempts (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection).
* Preventing command-and-control communication from compromised hosts.
* Mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.

To operate in IPS mode, Snort typically works with a **netfilter/iptables** setup on Linux or uses **NFQUEUE** for packet queuing and decision-making.

#### Packet Logging and Analysis

Snort can also operate purely as a **packet logger**, where it captures and logs packets for later analysis without inspecting them for malicious patterns in real-time.

Use cases include:

* Network diagnostics and troubleshooting.
* Retrospective investigation of traffic patterns during a suspected breach.
* Academic or lab-based research into network protocols and behaviors.
