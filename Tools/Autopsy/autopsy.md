## Reporting  

## Generating Reports in Autopsy

Autopsy, a powerful open-source digital forensics platform, provides comprehensive **reporting capabilities** essential for presenting findings in a legally admissible, organized, and customizable manner. Reporting is typically performed **after analysis is complete**, allowing investigators to document and communicate critical evidence effectively.

### Types of Reports

Autopsy supports several **report formats**, enabling flexibility depending on the audience and purpose of the investigation:

1. **HTML Reports**

   * **Purpose**: Interactive, web-viewable reports ideal for visual presentation and quick navigation.
   * **Features**:

     * Hyperlinked sections for ease of access.
     * Embedded thumbnails for media.
     * Easy to archive and share.

2. **CSV Reports**

   * **Purpose**: Structured data reports, ideal for spreadsheet-based review and quantitative analysis.
   * **Features**:

     * Easily opened in Excel or other tools.
     * Useful for parsing large quantities of artifacts programmatically.

3. **Excel (XLSX) Reports**

   * **Purpose**: Similar to CSV but with enhanced formatting and embedded charts or styles.
   * **Features**:

     * Often used in law enforcement reports or inter-agency briefings.

4. **XML/JSON Reports**

   * **Purpose**: Machine-readable formats suitable for integration with other forensic or case management systems.
   * **Use Case**: When automating post-processing or feeding into tools like CaseClosed or ElasticSearch.

5. **Body File Format**

   * **Purpose**: Generates timeline-compatible output for tools like `mactime` (part of The Sleuth Kit).
   * **Use Case**: Useful in generating chronological timelines of file system activity.

6. **KML Reports**

   * **Purpose**: Location-based reports usable with Google Earth.
   * **Use Case**: When handling geolocation artifacts from mobile devices or geotagged images.

### Customizing Report Content

Autopsy allows users to tailor reports based on **specific data needs** or **stakeholder requirements**:

* **Selective Artifact Inclusion**:

  * Choose what categories to include: Web History, Communications, Images, Videos, Files with Keywords, etc.
  * Narrow focus to only tagged or flagged items (e.g., contraband, incriminating documents).

* **Tag-Based Filtering**:

  * Reports can be generated based on **Examiner Tags** such as:

    * “Notable”
    * “Bookmark”
    * “Suspicious”
  * This helps highlight key findings or present only case-relevant material.

* **Metadata Control**:

  * Choose which metadata fields to include (e.g., file paths, hash values, timestamps).
  * Toggle full path vs. relative paths, MD5/SHA1/SSDEEP hash types, or evidence source details.

* **Module-Specific Output**:

  * Some modules (like Picture Analyzer or Recent Activity) offer their own custom reporting options.
  * Results from specific ingest modules can be exported separately for focused investigation reports.

### Exporting and Sharing Reports

Once reports are generated, Autopsy makes it simple to **export and disseminate findings** securely:

1. **Export Options**:

   * Reports are saved by default in the `Reports` folder under the case directory.
   * Users may specify alternate paths for external storage or encrypted containers.

2. **Sharing Reports**:

   * **HTML and CSV** can be zipped and emailed.
   * **XLSX** can be shared via secure cloud collaboration tools (e.g., OneDrive, SharePoint).
   * Sensitive data should be **encrypted with tools like VeraCrypt, GPG, or BitLocker** before distribution.

3. **Chain-of-Custody Compliance**:

   * Report exports are logged in the **Autopsy case log**.
   * It is recommended to hash and sign exported reports (e.g., using `sha256sum` + GPG) for evidentiary integrity.

4. **Interoperability**:

   * Reports can be imported into **SIEM platforms**, **timeline tools**, or **case management software** depending on the format chosen (CSV/JSON/XML).

### Best Practices for Reporting

* **Always review report previews** before final export to ensure accuracy and compliance.
* **Use tags religiously** throughout the investigation to simplify reporting later.
* **Version reports** clearly with timestamps and analyst initials to maintain accountability.
* **Consider audience**:

  * Use HTML for internal analyst briefings.
  * Use CSV/XLSX for legal or corporate stakeholders.
  * Use body file or JSON for technical integration or timeline reconstruction.
