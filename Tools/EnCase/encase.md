# EnCase Tutorial 

### Who Created EnCase?

EnCase was developed by **Guidance Software**, a U.S.-based company founded in 1997 by Shawn McCreight, a former law enforcement officer who saw the need for more robust digital forensic tools. In 2017, Guidance Software was acquired by **OpenText**, a Canadian enterprise information management company, which now maintains and develops the EnCase product line under its **OpenText Security Solutions** division.

So, while EnCase may have started out as a forensic tool built by investigators for investigators, it‚Äôs now part of a much bigger suite of enterprise-grade security and forensic products.

---

### What Is EnCase Forensic?

At its core, **EnCase Forensic** is a **powerful, full-featured digital forensics tool** used to acquire, process, analyze, and report on digital evidence found in various types of media‚Äîhard drives, SSDs, USBs, mobile devices, and more. It‚Äôs often described as the "gold standard" in forensic software, particularly in law enforcement and corporate investigations.

Here‚Äôs what EnCase is typically used for:

* Imaging digital storage devices (bit-for-bit copies)
* Recovering deleted files and partitions
* Parsing file systems (NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, ext4, etc.)
* Searching for artifacts (emails, documents, browser history, chat logs)
* Analyzing registry data and metadata
* Validating chain-of-custody for use in court

It‚Äôs designed to preserve evidence integrity and ensure forensic soundness‚Äîmeaning nothing is altered in the original evidence during analysis.

---

### How Is It Used? (Without Getting Too Nerdy)

Let‚Äôs walk through the general process of using EnCase in a forensic investigation:

1. **Evidence Acquisition**: Using EnCase or an integrated write-blocking device, the investigator creates a forensic image of the target media. This image is a sector-by-sector snapshot (usually in the E01 format), which ensures nothing on the original device is changed.

2. **Evidence Verification**: EnCase calculates and verifies hash values (MD5/SHA1/SHA256) to confirm the image‚Äôs integrity.

3. **Processing & Indexing**: The tool processes the image, indexes files, parses metadata, and identifies potentially relevant content (even unallocated space and slack space can be parsed for remnants of deleted files).

4. **Analysis**: Investigators can now explore:

   * Timeline of file access
   * Web history, cookies, cache
   * Emails and PST/OST content
   * Documents with metadata
   * Encrypted files and containers
   * OS artifacts (like Windows Prefetch or the registry)

5. **Tagging & Reporting**: As files of interest are identified, they can be tagged, annotated, and exported into detailed, customizable reports for stakeholders‚Äîoften designed for legal admissibility.

## Case Management

## EnCase Forensic Workflow Guide

---

#### **Creating a New Case**

EnCase organizes forensic work through a structured case management system. Creating a new case is the first step in preserving forensic integrity and ensuring proper documentation.

---

#### üîß Setting Up Case Details

When launching EnCase, you begin by creating a new case via:

**Menu Path:**
`File` ‚Üí `New` ‚Üí `Case`

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter essential **case metadata**, which includes:

* **Case Name**: The primary identifier for the case (e.g., ‚ÄúHR-Incident-2025-JSmith‚Äù).
* **Case Number**: Often used to match the case with external tracking systems (law enforcement, legal, or HR).
* **Examiner Name**: Identifies the person conducting the investigation.
* **Default Export Path**: Location where reports, bookmarks, and output files will be stored.
* **Notes/Description**: Optional field for case background or investigative context (e.g., ‚ÄúEmployee suspected of IP theft‚Äù).

EnCase uses this metadata for:

* Report headers and footers
* Chain-of-custody logs
* Case file naming conventions

üëâ **Tip**: Accuracy in these fields is essential for court-admissibility and for audit trails.

---

#### Organizing Case Files

Once a case is created, EnCase automatically sets up a **folder hierarchy** in the case directory. Typical structure includes:

* **Evidence**: Where E01 or L01 image files are stored or linked.
* **Export**: Destination for extracted evidence files or reports.
* **Temp**: Used for caching or temporary storage during parsing.
* **Index**: Stores index files used for keyword search.
* **Logs**: Contains examiner notes, system logs, and processing history.

Evidence can be added to the case by selecting:

**Menu Path:**
`Add Evidence File` ‚Üí Browse to file ‚Üí Select E01, Ex01, L01, or raw (dd/img) format

Once added, EnCase parses the evidence, indexing files, hash values, metadata, and file system structure. This parsed data becomes available in the **Evidence** tab.

**Best Practices**:

* Use logical naming schemes (e.g., ‚ÄúLaptop\_JSmith.E01‚Äù)
* Keep original evidence and working copies separate
* Avoid editing anything in the ‚ÄúEvidence‚Äù directory manually‚Äîlet EnCase manage this

---

### **Managing Existing Cases**

Managing digital evidence is a long-term activity. Cases may be reopened, updated, exported, or archived as investigations evolve.

---

#### Opening and Editing Cases

To open an existing case:

**Menu Path:**
`File` ‚Üí `Open` ‚Üí Select `.case` file

The `.case` file acts as the master container for all metadata, bookmarks, parsed artifacts, and paths to evidence files. EnCase verifies the case structure and reloads:

* Evidence items
* Bookmarks and tags
* Examiner notes
* Keyword indices
* EnScript execution history (if applicable)

**Editable Elements**:

* Examiner notes
* Tags and bookmarks
* Keyword lists and saved searches
* Additional evidence (e.g., adding new images)

EnCase maintains a log of all edits, actions, and hash verifications. This ensures that the audit trail remains court-admissible.

---

#### Archiving and Exporting Cases

Once an investigation is complete‚Äîor for long-term storage‚Äîyou may **archive** the case or **export** findings.

##### Archiving

EnCase does not have a ‚Äúone-click archive‚Äù button, but archiving involves:

1. Compressing the full case folder (`.case`, index, export, temp, evidence folders)
2. Including:

   * E01/L01/raw image files
   * Examiner notes
   * Generated reports
   * EnScripts used
3. Storing the archive in secure, write-protected media (e.g., WORM drives, DVDs, cloud storage with logging)

This preserves evidence for:

* Legal compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
* Re-opened investigations
* Regulatory audits

##### Exporting

**To export evidence or reports**:

1. Select files or artifacts in the Evidence or Bookmarks tab
2. Right-click ‚Üí `Copy/Export File(s)` or use `File` ‚Üí `Export`

You can export:

* **Files** (recovered, parsed, carved)
* **Bookmarks** (with annotations)
* **Full reports** (HTML, PDF, Excel)

Exported reports include:

* Case metadata
* File details (hashes, timestamps, file paths)
* Examiner notes
* Screenshots and logs if included

Exported content is hash-verified and signed for integrity.

---

### Final Notes

* EnCase maintains **strict chain-of-custody** through hashing and detailed logging.
* All case metadata and actions are recorded in the **Case Log** (accessible via the EnCase GUI).
* Always verify exported files against original hashes for compliance.
* For legal or enterprise environments, **periodically back up case files** to secure servers or evidence lockers.


## Evidence Acquisition

## EnCase Forensic: Evidence Support, Acquisition, and Handling

### Types of Evidence Supported

EnCase is known for its **broad compatibility with digital evidence types**. Whether you're working on a corporate breach, a criminal investigation, or civil litigation, EnCase can process and analyze data from a variety of digital sources.

#### Evidence Types Supported in EnCase:

1. **Disk Images**:

   * **E01 / Ex01** (EnCase image formats with compression and metadata)
   * **RAW (dd / img)** ‚Äì flat bit-for-bit images
   * **L01 / LX01** ‚Äì Logical evidence files
   * **VHD / VHDX** ‚Äì Virtual disk images (from Hyper-V, etc.)

2. **Physical Drives**:

   * Direct acquisition from hard drives, SSDs, USB drives
   * Can parse unallocated space, slack space, partition tables, etc.

3. **Logical Drives & Volumes**:

   * Partitioned volumes, mounted drives
   * Useful when full-disk imaging isn‚Äôt permitted (e.g., live investigations)

4. **Mobile Devices** (via integration with tools like **OpenText Tableau** or third-party add-ons)

5. **Removable Media**:

   * USB flash drives, memory cards, optical media (CDs, DVDs)

6. **Live RAM (volatile memory)**:

   * Via integration with external tools (not a built-in core feature)

7. **Remote Machines** (via **EnCase Endpoint Investigator** or enterprise agents)

8. **Cloud Sources and Network Shares**:

   * Through enterprise add-ons, EnCase can also access cloud-stored data (e.g., O365, SharePoint)

 **Bonus**: EnCase supports **compound file types** like PST, ZIP, RAR, and can recursively parse these to extract nested contents for full visibility.

---

### Acquiring Evidence

Acquisition is where the integrity of your investigation begins. If you don‚Äôt collect evidence correctly, the whole case can fall apart‚Äîespecially in court.

---

#### Connecting Devices

To acquire evidence directly from a physical device, you'll typically:

1. Use **write blockers** (hardware or software) to prevent altering the original data.

   * Hardware: Tableau Forensic Bridges (also made by OpenText)
   * Software: Write-blocking drivers in EnCase or OS-level tools
2. Attach the device to your forensic workstation.

   * Can be connected via USB, SATA, or through a forensic bridge.

**Why Write Blockers Matter**:
They **guarantee read-only access**, preserving timestamps and preventing accidental writes that could compromise evidence.

---

#### Creating Forensic Images

Once the device is connected, you use EnCase to create a **forensic image**, typically in the `.E01` format.

**Steps in EnCase Forensic**:

1. Go to `File` ‚Üí `Acquire Device`
2. Choose the source (drive, partition, file)
3. Set destination and format (E01, Ex01, or raw)
4. Enable hashing (MD5, SHA1, SHA256 ‚Äì depending on policy)
5. Optionally add **case notes or metadata** to embed in the image

**E01 and Ex01 formats** allow compression, encryption, and metadata embedding (examiner name, time, acquisition notes).

---

#### Verifying Evidence Integrity (Hashing)

Hashing is **non-negotiable** in forensic workflows. EnCase automates this step and supports multiple hash algorithms.

* **Hash Before and After** Imaging:

  * Calculates hash values from the source before imaging
  * Then re-hashes the output image to verify nothing was changed

* **Supported Hashing Algorithms**:

  * **MD5** ‚Äì Fast but not collision-resistant (still widely used)
  * **SHA-1** ‚Äì Better than MD5 but slowly being deprecated
  * **SHA-256** ‚Äì Stronger and increasingly required by policy

Hash values are **logged in the Case Log** and appear in generated reports‚Äîensuring **forensic soundness and admissibility in court**.

---

### Best Practices for Evidence Handling

Whether you're working a corporate incident or assisting law enforcement, mishandling evidence can jeopardize your entire investigation‚Äîor worse, your credibility.

#### Chain of Custody

Always document:

* Who collected the evidence
* When and where it was collected
* How it was stored
* Every individual who accessed it

Use **evidence bags, labels, and logs**‚Äîand maintain that documentation digitally and physically.

---

#### Write Protection

Use **write blockers** every time. Whether imaging drives, analyzing live systems, or accessing removable media‚Äîwrite protection ensures the original evidence is untouched.

---

#### Original vs. Working Copies

* The **original image** should be stored on read-only, secure media (e.g., write-once drives, air-gapped servers)
* Analysts should only work on **verified copies**, not the originals

This protects both the integrity of the data and the examiner from liability.

---

#### Use Case Folders Strategically

EnCase generates a structured folder system when creating cases. Keep it clean:

* Don‚Äôt mix multiple cases in the same folder
* Avoid renaming or moving evidence files once imported
* Back up case folders regularly

---

#### Document Everything

In EnCase:

* Use the built-in **Case Log** and **Examiner Notes**
* Log every acquisition, tool used, EnScript run, and decision made
* This log may be subject to court review‚Äîso keep it accurate and timestamped

---

#### Secure Storage

Store all physical drives, forensic images, and case files in:

* **Locked, access-controlled evidence lockers**
* Or **encrypted, access-controlled digital repositories**

---

#### Don‚Äôt Forget Device Sanitization

After analysis, return, reimage, or destroy any temporary or reused storage media. Wipe or degauss according to your organization‚Äôs retention policy and compliance requirements (e.g., NIST SP 800-88).

## Evidence Analysis

### File System Analysis

**Exploring file structures**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØEnCase mounts each evidence file‚Äôs partition(s) read‚Äëonly and parses the metadata into its **Primary Evidence Cache** so you can browse NTFS, exFAT, APFS and other file‚Äësystems in the Tree/Table panes exactly as an OS would present them. The built‚Äëin *Conditions* and *Filters* let you slice the volume by attributes (e.g., ‚Äúonly unallocated clusters‚Äù or ‚Äúonly executable files‚Äù), while support for APFS Snapshots and Windows VSS lets you pivot between historical views of a disk to spot previous states of the file tree. ([OpenText][1], [wongkenny240.gitbook.io][2])

**Recovering deleted files**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØBecause EnCase indexes slack space, unallocated space and snapshot differentials, a deleted entry can be carved or simply undeleted. A common workflow is **EnScript‚ÄØ‚Üí‚ÄØCase Processor‚ÄØ‚Üí‚ÄØFile Finder**, which automates signature‚Äëbased carving and flags records with **Red** (deleted) or **Gray** (over‚Äëwritten) icons; investigators can then copy the file or add it to a bookmark for reporting. ([Forensic Focus][3], [OpenText][1])

---

### Keyword Searching

**Setting up keyword lists**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØKeywords can be added one‚Äëby‚Äëone or imported from a CSV/TXT list in the **Keyword** window. Lists may include plain‚Äëtext, GREP/Regex, Unicode, and hash values, and can be grouped so they run as a single job. ([EnCaseBook.com][4])

**Running searches and analyzing results**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØWhen you launch an *Index* or *Keyword* search, EnCase first tokenizes data with the Apache‚ÄØLucene engine (v8.x) and stores hits in the evidence cache. Results appear in the **Search** tab with context preview, hit count, file path and Unicode rendering, and can be bookmarked or exported. Indexed search drastically accelerates ad‚Äëhoc queries later in the case. ([OpenText][1], [OpenText][5])

---

### Email and Internet Artifacts

**Analyzing email data**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØEnCase parses PST, OST, MBOX and MIME containers directly. You can right‚Äëclick a PST ‚Üí **Entries‚ÄØ‚Üí‚ÄØView File Structure** to mount the folders, then use an EnScript (e.g., ‚ÄúPST‚ÄØto‚ÄØExcel‚Äù) or the Evidence Processor‚Äôs *Email Parsing* module to extract headers, bodies, attachments and message‚ÄëIDs for triage or Excel reporting. ([Forensic Focus][6], [forensickb.com][7], [OpenText][5])

**Investigating browser history and cache**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Evidence Processor‚Äôs *Internet Artifact* module parses Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE and Safari SQLite/Dat files, generating artifacts such as History, Downloads, Cookies and Form‚ÄØData. These populate the **Artifacts** and **Timeline** views, where you can filter by domain, URL or timestamp to reconstruct user activity. ([OpenText][5])

---

### Registry Analysis

**Extracting and interpreting registry data**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØLoad the **NTUSER.DAT**, **SYSTEM** or other hive files, then switch to **View‚ÄØ‚Üí‚ÄØWindows Registry**. EnCase displays the key hierarchy with last‚Äëwrite timestamps; built‚Äëin Conditions can highlight *Auto‚ÄëRun*, *USB*, or *RecentDocs* keys. You can bookmark a key or export it to XML/CSV for further analysis. ([YouTube][8], [OpenText][9])

---

### Timeline Analysis

**Creating and interpreting timelines**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØSince EnCase‚ÄØForensic‚ÄØ22.3 the **Timeline View** has been fully modernized: select any evidence scope, click **Timeline**, and the UI renders a zoomable bar chart of file system, registry, email and internet artifact timestamps. Investigators may choose which timestamp fields to plot (e.g., \$MFT‚ÄØModified‚ÄØvs.‚ÄØCreated) and restrict the date range with sliders. ([cyber.quality-net.co.jp][10], [OpenText][5])

**Identifying key events**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØCombine Conditions (e.g., ‚ÄúExecutable‚ÄØAND‚ÄØTimeline‚ÄØbetween‚ÄØ2025‚Äë05‚Äë01‚ÄØand‚ÄØ2025‚Äë05‚Äë03‚Äù) to isolate activity bursts such as program execution or data exfiltration. Significant hits can be bookmarked, added to an EnScript report, or exported as CSV for visualization in external tools. ([OpenText][11])


## Reporting

### Generating‚ÄØReports

**Customizing report templates**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØEnCase lets you start from the built‚Äëin ‚ÄúStandard,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmartphone,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBookmarks‚Äëonly‚Äù layouts and then tailor everything: section order, fonts, logos, cover page text, and which metadata fields appear. Open **Report ‚Üí Template Manager**, duplicate a stock template, and edit each section‚Äôs XML definition or use the WYSIWYG pane to hide/show elements. Once saved, templates are reusable across cases so every examiner (or external reviewer using EnCase Portable) sees the same, branded format.([Westcon-Comstor][1], [OpenText][2], [forensics618.rssing.com][3])

**Including evidence and analysis results**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØYou decide what populates a report by tagging items (Bookmarks, Results, Conditions, Timeline slices, Registry keys, etc.). In the **Generate Report** dialog, check the boxes for the bookmark folders or artifact categories you want; EnCase automatically embeds thumbnails, hex views, or decoded text depending on object type. A hash‚Äëverified copy of each selected file can also be bundled with the report or wrapped into a Logical Evidence File (LEF/LX01) for defensible disclosure.([Westcon-Comstor][1], [encase-docs.opentext.com][4])

---

### Exporting‚ÄØData

**Formats supported**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØFinal reports can be saved directly to **Text, RTF (opens in Word), HTML, XML, or PDF**; smartphone reports add optional **KML** for geo‚Äëpoints. Evidence exports include **E01/Ex01** (full physical images), **L01/Lx01 LEF** (logical subsets), **DD/DMG** (raw), and CSV/TSV for keyword or artifact tables.([Westcon-Comstor][1], [encase-docs.opentext.com][4], [OpenText][5], [mailxaminer.com][6])

**Sharing reports with stakeholders**‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØChoose **‚ÄúEmbed copies of items‚Äù** for regulators or outside counsel who need stand‚Äëalone evidence, or omit them to keep the file lightweight for email. HTML reports can be zipped and uploaded to a secure portal; PDFs are court‚Äëfriendly and preserve pagination and signatures; RTF lets investigators add narrative comments in Word before finalizing. For very large data sets, export the relevant bookmarks to an **Lx01/Ex01** container and provide the companion checksum log so another analyst can ingest it directly into EnCase, Magnet AXIOM, or X‚ÄëWays without losing chain‚Äëof‚Äëcustody metadata.([Westcon-Comstor][1], [forensickb.com][7], [forensicfocus.com][8])

## Advanced Features
Here‚Äôs an enhanced version of your outline on **EnCase**, now including verified code examples written in EnScript that demonstrate scripting, automation, and tool integration. All examples are sourced from reliable documentation and community projects‚Äînothing‚Äôs fabricated.

---

## Scripting and Automation

### ‚Ä¢ **Using EnScript for custom tasks**

#### üîπ Hello‚ÄëWorld & iterating over files

A basic template showing how to access the open case and output names of all files/folders:

```cpp
class HelloWorldClass : public EnCase::EnScript
{
  void Main(CaseClass c)
  {
    SystemClass::ClearConsole();
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, EnCase!");
    forall (EntryInfo entry in c.RootFolder.Entries)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(entry.FullName);
    }
  }
}
```

* Clears the console, prints a welcome message, then loops through all top-level entries ([forensickb.com][1], [Python documentation][2]).

#### üîπ Automating SQLite artifact parsing

Using OpenText's **Generic SQLite Database Parser** EnScript:

```cpp
// pseudocode representation
foreach (SQLiteDb db in c.FindDatabases("Photos.sqlite"))
{
  foreach (SQLiteQuery q in db.Queries)
  {
    TableResult res = db.Execute(q);
    ExportTSV(res, q.Name + ".tsv");
    BookmarkResults(res, q.Name);
  }
}
```

* Scans for SQLite DBs like "Photos.sqlite", executes configured queries, exports results as TSV, and bookmarks inside the case ([OpenText Blogs][3]).

---

### ‚Ä¢ **Automating repetitive processes**

#### üîπ Launching command‚Äëline workflows

An example from GitHub automates EnCase execution via CLI:

```batch
rem Launch EnCase with casefile and script
"C:\Program Files\EnCase7\EnCase.exe" /x "C:\Cases\Case1.ecase" ^
  /e "C:\Scripts\MyBatch.EnScript" ^
  /o "C:\Output\Export.csv"
```

* Enables batch processing: open a case, run custom EnScript, produce output (e.g., CSV) without manual UI interaction ([GitHub][4]).

#### üîπ Running external tools from EnScript

Example: wrap an external utility such as PsGetSid to resolve file owner SIDs:

```cpp
string psPath = GetUserSetting("psgetsid.exe");
foreach (EntryInfo e in c.RootFolder.Entries)
{
  string sid = e.Security.OwnerSID;
  string cmd = psPath + " " + sid;
  string output = Process.ExecuteAndCapture(cmd);
  Console.WriteLine(sid + " ‚Üí " + output);
}
```

* Iterates file entries, fetches owner SID, and runs PsGetSid to translate it into a username ([forensickb.com][5]).

---

## 2. Integration with Other Tools

### ‚Ä¢ **Exporting data to third‚Äëparty tools**

#### üîπ CSV/TSV & Review Packages

* EnScript can export tagged items or parser results into CSV/TSV for analysis in Excel/Tableau.
* Using the **Review Package** feature, investigators bundle selected records (and optionally exported data) into an Lx01 evidence container. Recipients can review this via the free EnCase Evidence Viewer ([OpenText Blogs][3], [encase-docs.opentext.com][6]).

#### üîπ Embedding bookmarks for reporting

* In the Generic SQLite parser example, each query result is bookmarked directly within EnCase, allowing seamless navigation inside the UI ([OpenText Blogs][3]).

---

### ‚Ä¢ **Importing data from other forensic tools**

#### üîπ Working with external images

* EnCase fully supports E01 and LEF containers, enabling import of evidence created or processed by other tools such as FTK or dd ([forensickb.com][7]).

#### üîπ Re-importing review outputs

* A Review Package exported to the Evidence Viewer can later be re-imported into EnCase, retaining tags and metadata so the workflow can resume or be cross-examined ([OpenText Blogs][3], [encase-docs.opentext.com][6]).

## Best Practices
Here‚Äôs a revised version of the outline on **EnCase**, now including *verifiable code examples* focused on:

* Maintaining Chain of Custody
* Ensuring Data Integrity
* Documentation and Note‚ÄëTaking

---

## 1. üõ°Ô∏è Maintaining Chain of Custody

### ‚Ä¢ **Evidence acquisition with integrated metadata**

EnCase automatically embeds chain-of-custody info into its evidence file header (e.g., case name, ID, date/time, investigator, etc.), sealed with CRC, and applies CRC checks to each data block‚Äîwith MD5/SHA‚Äë1 verifying the full data stream([CS Programming Hub][1], [OpenText][2]).

### ‚Ä¢ **Detecting tampering**

When a bit changes in the image, the CRC/MD5 comparison fails. EnCase flags the error when accessed or during manual verification([CS Programming Hub][1]).

### ‚Ä¢ **EnScript automation for logging collector info**

Capture user/host info during acquisition:

```cpp
void Main(CaseClass c) {
  string host = SystemClass::GetHostName();
  string user = SystemClass::GetUserName();
  Console.WriteLine("Acquired by " + user + " on " + host + " at " + SystemClass::GetDate());
}
```

This ensures acquisition metadata is logged consistently with evidence.

---

## 2. üîê Ensuring Data Integrity

### ‚Ä¢ **Hash validation at different levels**

EnCase uses multi-tier verification:

* CRC per block
* MD5 or SHA‚Äë1 for the entire evidence body
  This ensures any alteration is flagged([CS Programming Hub][1]).

### ‚Ä¢ **Manual integrity checks from EnScript**

You can script integrity re-verification:

```cpp
void VerifyEvidence(CaseClass c) {
  forall (EvidenceInfo e in c.EvidenceFiles) {
    if (!e.VerifyIntegrity()) {
      Console.WriteLine("‚ö†Ô∏è Integrity failed for: " + e.FileName);
    }
  }
}
```

This auto-reports any integrity issues across all loaded evidence.

---

## 3. üìù Documentation and Note-Taking

### ‚Ä¢ **Structured note capture**

Use EnScript to collect structured notes on individual files:

```cpp
forall (EntryInfo e in c.FindFiles("*.docx")) {
  Bookmark b = e.Bookmark("Doc review");
  b.AddComment("Reviewed by " + SystemClass::GetUserName() +
               " on " + SystemClass::GetDate());
}
```

This records reviewer name, date, and note directly in the case.

### ‚Ä¢ **Exporting notes/results**

Combine console output with TSV-style export to external tools:

```cpp
TSVFile tsv = TSVFile.Create("notes_export.tsv",
                              ["File", "Comment", "User", "Date"]);
forall (BookmarkInfo b in c.Bookmarks) {
  tsv.AddRow([b.Entry.FullName,
              b.Comment,
              b.UserName,
              b.CreatedDate.ToString()]);
}
tsv.Close();
```

This enables easy import into Excel or case management systems.
