# Rekall  

Rekall is an advanced open-source memory forensics framework designed to assist investigators in analyzing volatile memory (RAM) for digital evidence. It is widely used in cybersecurity and digital forensics to uncover malicious activities, detect malware, and analyze system behavior.

### What Rekall Does  
Rekall enables users to extract and analyze information from memory dumps, such as running processes, loaded modules, open handles, and network activity. It provides a suite of plugins for specific tasks, including process enumeration, timeline analysis, and artifact detection. Rekall is particularly effective in identifying hidden or malicious processes, injected code, and other anomalies that may not be visible through traditional disk-based analysis.

### How Rekall Works  
Rekall operates by loading a memory image and parsing its structure using profiles tailored to the operating system of the target machine. These profiles allow Rekall to interpret the memory layout and extract meaningful data. Users interact with Rekall through its command-line interface (CLI), where they can execute plugins and commands to perform targeted analysis. Rekall also supports automation through scripting, enabling batch processing and custom workflows.

### When to Use Rekall  
- **Use Rekall When:**
    - Investigating malware infections or advanced persistent threats (APTs).
    - Analyzing memory dumps for forensic evidence in incident response.
    - Detecting rootkits, injected code, or hidden processes.
    - Performing in-depth analysis of system behavior and artifacts.

- **Avoid Using Rekall When:**
    - Disk-based analysis or file recovery is sufficient for the investigation.
    - The memory dump is corrupted or unavailable.
    - Real-time monitoring or live system analysis is required (Rekall works on static memory images).

Rekall is a powerful tool for memory forensics, but it requires expertise in interpreting results and understanding memory structures. It is best suited for scenarios where volatile memory analysis is critical to uncovering evidence or understanding an incident.
