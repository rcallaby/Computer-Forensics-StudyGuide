# Rekall  

Rekall is an advanced open-source memory forensics framework designed to assist investigators in analyzing volatile memory (RAM) for digital evidence. It is widely used in cybersecurity and digital forensics to uncover malicious activities, detect malware, and analyze system behavior.

### What Rekall Does  
Rekall enables users to extract and analyze information from memory dumps, such as running processes, loaded modules, open handles, and network activity. It provides a suite of plugins for specific tasks, including process enumeration, timeline analysis, and artifact detection. Rekall is particularly effective in identifying hidden or malicious processes, injected code, and other anomalies that may not be visible through traditional disk-based analysis.

### How Rekall Works  
Rekall operates by loading a memory image and parsing its structure using profiles tailored to the operating system of the target machine. These profiles allow Rekall to interpret the memory layout and extract meaningful data. Users interact with Rekall through its command-line interface (CLI), where they can execute plugins and commands to perform targeted analysis. Rekall also supports automation through scripting, enabling batch processing and custom workflows.

### When to Use Rekall  
- **Use Rekall When:**
    - Investigating malware infections or advanced persistent threats (APTs).
    - Analyzing memory dumps for forensic evidence in incident response.
    - Detecting rootkits, injected code, or hidden processes.
    - Performing in-depth analysis of system behavior and artifacts.

- **Avoid Using Rekall When:**
    - Disk-based analysis or file recovery is sufficient for the investigation.
    - The memory dump is corrupted or unavailable.
    - Real-time monitoring or live system analysis is required (Rekall works on static memory images).

Rekall is a powerful tool for memory forensics, but it requires expertise in interpreting results and understanding memory structures. It is best suited for scenarios where volatile memory analysis is critical to uncovering evidence or understanding an incident.

## 2. Memory Forensics Basics  

#### What is Memory Forensics?

Memory forensics, also known as memory analysis, is the process of examining a computer's volatile memory (RAM) to extract digital artifacts for forensic and investigative purposes. This analysis is crucial for uncovering evidence of cybercrimes, attacks, and other system activities that may not leave traces on permanent storage. By analyzing RAM, investigators can access data such as running processes, network connections, encryption keys, login credentials, and malware that may not be stored on a hard disk. ([nordvpn.com][1], [hadess.io][2])

---

#### Importance of Memory Analysis in Investigations

Analyzing volatile memory is vital in digital investigations because it can reveal critical information that is not available through traditional disk-based forensics. RAM stores data temporarily while a computer is running, including live malware, active processes, and network connections. This data is lost when the system is powered off, making timely memory analysis essential. Memory forensics enables investigators to detect advanced threats, such as fileless malware and insider attacks, by uncovering hidden evidence that may not be present on the hard drive. ([levelblue.com][3], [ituonline.com][4], [digitalguardian.com][5])

## 3. Rekall Command-Line Interface (CLI)  

##### Navigating the Rekall CLI

Rekall is a powerful memory forensics framework that operates through a command-line interface (CLI), allowing analysts to interact with memory images or live systems directly. Once installed, you can start the Rekall shell by executing the `rekall` command in your terminal or command prompt. This shell provides an interactive environment where you can load memory images, execute analysis plugins, and explore memory artifacts.

---

##### Basic Commands

### `rekall -h` for Help

To view the available command-line options and get assistance with Rekall's usage, you can use the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```bash
rekall -h
```



This command will display a list of available options and commands, helping you understand how to interact with Rekall effectively.

### Loading Memory Images

To analyze a memory image, you need to load it into Rekall. This can be done using the `-f` flag followed by the path to the memory image file:

```bash
rekall -f /path/to/memory/image.raw
```



Once the memory image is loaded, you can execute various plugins to analyze different aspects of the memory. For example, to list the running processes:

```bash
rekall -f /path/to/memory/image.raw pslist
```



This command will output a list of processes found in the memory image.

---

##### Using Profiles for Compatibility with Different Operating Systems

Rekall utilizes profiles to interpret the structures within memory images accurately. These profiles contain information about the operating system's kernel and are essential for correct analysis.

Rekall has a dynamic profiling engine that enables on-the-fly kernel structure discovery, making it particularly useful in live response scenarios. This feature allows Rekall to automatically detect and use the appropriate profile for a given memory image, reducing the need for manual profile selection. ([medium.com][1])

However, in cases where automatic detection fails or you want to specify a profile manually, you can use the `--profile` option:

```bash
rekall -f /path/to/memory/image.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64
```



Replace `Win7SP1x64` with the appropriate profile name for your memory image. You can list available profiles using the following command:

```bash
rekall list_profiles
```



This command will display a list of profiles that Rekall can use for analysis.
