# Course Outline: bstrings Tool  

## 1. Introduction to bstrings  

### Overview of bstrings

**bstring** (short for "better string" or "binary string") is an open-source C library designed to make string handling in C safer and more powerful. Traditional C strings (`char *`) are prone to common bugs such as buffer overflows and undefined behaviors due to poor bounds checking and manual memory management. **bstring** provides a managed string type (`bstring`) with accompanying functions for common string operations, reducing these risks.

**Official project page**: [https://github.com/antirez/bstring](https://github.com/antirez/bstring) — (one of the original popular forks; also used in several other C projects).

### Purpose and Use Cases

**Purpose:**

* To replace standard C string handling (`char *`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, etc.) with safer, more powerful abstractions.
* To manage memory internally (similar to higher-level languages), while providing simple APIs for:

  * Concatenation
  * Substrings
  * Searching
  * Tokenization
  * Formatting
  * Comparison
  * Encoding/decoding
  * Binary-safe operations (strings with embedded null bytes)

**Typical Use Cases:**

* **Embedded systems** — when you want safer string handling but can't use C++ STL or third-party frameworks.
* **Security-sensitive code** — to avoid common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
* **Parsing** or **tokenizing text data**.
* **Dynamic text generation** where fixed-size buffers are too limiting.
* Lightweight C projects needing managed string operations without heavy dependencies.

### Installation and Setup

#### Supported Platforms

* **Operating systems**:

  * Linux
  * macOS
  * Windows (via MinGW or MSVC)
  * BSD variants

* **Compilers**:

  * GCC
  * Clang
  * MSVC

* **Languages**:

  * C (C89 and newer)
  * Usable in C++ projects (extern "C")

#### Downloading and Installing

**Option 1: Clone from GitHub**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antirez/bstring.git
cd bstring
make
sudo make install
```

This will typically install the `bstrlib.h` and `bstrlib.c` (and optionally other headers).

**Option 2: Manual install**

1. Download from GitHub releases or clone the repo.
2. Copy the `bstrlib.h` and `bstrlib.c` files into your project.
3. Add `bstrlib.c` to your build system (e.g., `gcc main.c bstrlib.c -o myprogram`).

**Option 3: Use via package manager** (only on some Linux distributions — check availability)

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu systems (if packaged)
sudo apt-get install libbstrlib-dev
```

**Basic Build Example:**

```bash
gcc -o myapp main.c bstrlib.c
```

Or with CMake:

```cmake
add_executable(myapp main.c bstrlib.c)
```

## 2. Understanding Strings in Binary Files  

### What are Strings in Binary Files?

In the context of binary files, **strings** refer to sequences of human-readable characters (such as text, commands, file paths, URLs, and passwords) embedded within otherwise non-human-readable data (machine code, file headers, etc.).

These character sequences:

* May be stored in **plain text** (null-terminated or length-prefixed), or
* May appear in **encoded** or **compressed** forms.
* Can include **ASCII**, **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, or even custom encodings.

Binary files like executables (`.exe`), object files, memory dumps, disk images, and proprietary file formats often contain such embedded text — left by developers, libraries, compilers, or user data.

**Common string examples in binaries:**

* Developer comments
* Hardcoded credentials
* Debug output
* File paths
* Domain names or IPs
* Error messages
* Command-line options
* Configuration strings

*Tool example*:
The Unix `strings` tool is often used to extract readable strings from binaries:

```bash
strings mybinaryfile.exe
```

---

### ASCII vs Unicode Strings

**ASCII Strings:**

* Represented using the 7-bit **ASCII** encoding standard.
* Basic character set: 128 characters (printable characters + control codes).
* Often used in legacy software, embedded systems, and simple binaries.

**Unicode Strings:**

* Represent text in **multiple languages and symbol sets**.
* Encodings include:

  * **UTF-8** (variable-length, backward-compatible with ASCII)
  * **UTF-16** (common in Windows binaries, 2 or 4 bytes per character)
  * **UTF-32**
* Used in modern applications to support **internationalization** and **complex character sets**.

**Forensic relevance**:
Modern binaries often use **Unicode** internally, especially on Windows. Using a tool that extracts only ASCII strings may miss critical evidence. Forensic tools like **BinText**, **FLOSS**, and **bulk\_extractor** can extract both ASCII and Unicode strings.

---

### Importance of Extracting Strings in Forensics

Extracting strings from binary files is a **critical technique in digital forensics and reverse engineering** because:

1. **Human-readable clues**:

   * Strings can provide **context** about the file’s purpose or contents without needing full disassembly.
   * Reveal file paths, filenames, author names, build timestamps.

2. **Malware analysis**:

   * Identify **command and control (C2)** servers.
   * Discover **hardcoded credentials** or **encryption keys**.
   * See **obfuscation techniques**.

3. **Memory forensics**:

   * Extract remnants of sensitive data (like **passwords**, **email content**) from memory dumps.

4. **Triage and rapid assessment**:

   * Strings extraction is **fast** and helps prioritize deeper analysis.

5. **Evidence of user actions**:

   * Recover **chat messages**, **URLs**, **filenames** from slack space or disk images.

6. **Detection of steganography or covert channels**:

   * Look for **hidden messages** within seemingly random binaries.

**Tools commonly used:**

* `strings` (Linux, Windows)
* FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver)
* BinText
* bulk\_extractor
* Ghidra and IDA Pro (built-in string extraction features)
* Volatility (for memory dumps)

## 3. Basic Usage of bstrings  

### Command-line Syntax

**bstrings** (the bstrlib C library) is a **programming library**, not a command-line tool — so it does not have a standalone command-line interface or command-line syntax.

However, you can create your own **C programs** that use bstrings functions to extract, manipulate, and filter string data — and those programs can accept command-line arguments, like this:

```bash
./my_bstring_tool inputfile.bin
```

**In summary**: bstrings is used **via C API functions** inside your own programs — it is not an end-user CLI tool like `strings`.

---

### Extracting Strings from a File

To use **bstrings** for extracting string data from a file, you would typically:

1. **Open the file** in binary mode
2. **Read data** into a buffer
3. **Wrap the data** in a `bstring` object (if you want to use bstring functions)
4. **Search for and extract readable strings**

**Example (simplified):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "bstrlib.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <file>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    FILE *fp = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    if (!fp) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read file into bstring
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
    long size = ftell(fp);
    rewind(fp);

    unsigned char *buffer = malloc(size);
    fread(buffer, 1, size, fp);
    fclose(fp);

    bstring fileData = blk2bstr(buffer, size);
    free(buffer);

    // Now you can manipulate fileData with bstring functions!
    printf("File size: %d bytes\n", blength(fileData));

    bdestroy(fileData);
    return 0;
}
```

### Filtering ASCII and Unicode Strings

**Filtering strings** with bstrings is done **programmatically** by using:

* **Character tests** (`iscntrl()`, `isprint()`, `isascii()`) in C
* Loops through the `bstring` data
* Building new filtered bstrings based on criteria

**Example: Filtering printable ASCII characters:**

```c
bstring printable = bfromcstr("");

for (int i = 0; i < blength(fileData); i++) {
    unsigned char c = bchar(fileData, i);
    if (isprint(c)) {
        bconchar(printable, c);
    }
}

printf("Extracted printable ASCII: %s\n", bdata(printable));
bdestroy(printable);
```

---

**Handling Unicode**:

* bstrings operates on **byte buffers**, so it does not interpret encodings by default.
* If you know the file is **UTF-16**, you would process the data in **2-byte units** and use an external Unicode library (like ICU or libunistring), or write your own handling to convert to UTF-8 `bstring`s.

---

**Summary**:

* **Command-line syntax** — Not applicable (bstrings is a C API)
* **Extracting strings** — Read file into `bstring` and process as needed
* **Filtering ASCII / Unicode** — Loop over `bstring` data and apply filters programmatically

## 4. Advanced Features of bstrings  

### Using Options and Flags

Since **bstrings** is a **programming library**, it does not itself support CLI options or flags like `-n`. However — if you write a C program that uses bstrings, you can **implement your own options and flags** by parsing `argc`/`argv`, for example:

```c
./my_bstrings_tool -n 6 -ascii myfile.bin
```

You would then:

* Parse `-n 6` → set a minimum string length filter
* Parse `-ascii` or `-unicode` → set desired character set filtering

You can use `getopt()` or similar for parsing arguments in C.

---

#### Minimum String Length (`-n`)

To implement **minimum string length**, after loading a file into a `bstring`, you would scan for sequences of printable characters, keeping track of their length:

```c
int minlen = 6;  // Example from -n 6
bstring current = bfromcstr("");

for (int i = 0; i < blength(fileData); i++) {
    unsigned char c = bchar(fileData, i);
    if (isprint(c)) {
        bconchar(current, c);
    } else {
        if (blength(current) >= minlen) {
            printf("%s\n", bdata(current));
        }
        btrunc(current, 0);  // Reset
    }
}

if (blength(current) >= minlen) {
    printf("%s\n", bdata(current));
}
bdestroy(current);
```

---

#### Filtering by Character Set

**ASCII filtering** is straightforward with `isprint()` or `isascii()`:

```c
if (isascii(c) && isprint(c)) { ... }
```

**Unicode filtering** is more advanced:

* bstrings operates on **raw bytes**, so it does not parse UTF-16 or UTF-8 by itself.
* You can:

  * Use external Unicode libraries (ICU, libiconv) + bstrings
  * Or scan manually for UTF-16 sequences (Windows memory dumps, PE files)

---

### Extracting Strings from Memory Dumps

You can absolutely use **bstrings** to extract strings from memory dumps:

**Steps:**

1. Load the entire dump file (`.raw`, `.mem`, `.dmp`) into a `bstring`.
2. Scan for readable ASCII or Unicode sequences as above.
3. Optionally, match against known patterns (URLs, file paths, API calls).

**Example:**

```c
FILE *fp = fopen("memdump.raw", "rb");
fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
long size = ftell(fp);
rewind(fp);

unsigned char *buffer = malloc(size);
fread(buffer, 1, size, fp);
fclose(fp);

bstring memdump = blk2bstr(buffer, size);
free(buffer);

// Now scan memdump as shown earlier
```

**This works very well for:**

* Windows memory captures (Volatility output)
* Linux `/proc/kcore`
* MacOS crash dumps

---

### Recursive Directory Scanning

**bstrings itself does not handle directory traversal** — but in C you can easily combine bstrings with:

* POSIX `opendir()` / `readdir()` for Linux/Unix
* `FindFirstFile` / `FindNextFile` on Windows
* Or cross-platform: `dirent.h` (portable library)

**Approach:**

1. Write recursive directory traversal.
2. For each file:

   * Open and load into a `bstring`
   * Apply your string extraction logic

**Pseudo-code example:**

```c
void scan_dir(const char *path) {
    DIR *d = opendir(path);
    struct dirent *entry;

    while ((entry = readdir(d)) != NULL) {
        if (entry->d_type == DT_DIR) {
            // recurse into subdir if needed
        } else {
            // open file and process
            process_file(entry->d_name);
        }
    }
    closedir(d);
}
```

## 5. Practical Applications  

## **bstrings in Computer Forensics**

### Analyzing Executable Files

**bstrings** is frequently used to extract printable strings from executable files (e.g., PE, ELF, or Mach-O). Unlike basic `strings` utilities, **bstrings** applies context-aware filtering to reveal **high-value strings**—for instance:

* URLs, IP addresses
* Registry keys
* Windows file paths
* API calls
* Base64-encoded payloads

This makes it extremely useful when reverse-engineering malware or investigating suspicious binaries.

**Use Case Example:**
A reverse engineer examining a Windows PE file could use:

```bash
bstrings malware.exe
```

By using the `--presets malware` or specifying `--include pattern` flags, the analyst can extract indicators of compromise (IOCs) more efficiently than with traditional tools.

---

### Extracting Metadata from Documents

Although **bstrings** is not a metadata parser like `exiftool`, it can still assist in **uncovering embedded or hidden strings** within document files like `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.rtf` that might point to:

* Author or user names
* Paths from the originating machine (e.g., `C:\Users\John\Documents`)
* Hidden macros or suspicious scripts
* Obfuscated command-line calls or PowerShell

It is particularly useful when dealing with **spear-phishing attachments** or **malicious office documents**.

**Use Case Example:**
To analyze a potentially malicious `.docx`:

```bash
bstrings suspicious.docx --include path,user,cmd
```

This can reveal operational artifacts not shown by static metadata tools alone.

* SANS Internet Storm Center Blog: Analysis of malicious document artifacts

---

### 🛠 Investigating Malicious Files

**bstrings** is designed to help malware analysts and threat hunters **quickly triage binaries, scripts, or documents** to look for:

* Embedded scripts (VBS, PowerShell, JavaScript)
* Encoded payloads
* Fileless execution indicators
* Command-and-control (C2) domains or IPs
* Suspicious hardcoded credentials or tokens

It helps reduce time spent manually searching for these indicators by highlighting strings of interest based on built-in patterns or user-defined rules.

**Use Case Example:**
You can scan a malicious script and extract only PowerShell commands:

```bash
bstrings payload.ps1 --include powershell
```

**Reference:**

* [bstrings usage examples](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bstrings#usage)
* Huntress Labs and SANS DFIR reports on triaging malicious files

---

### Use in Digital Forensics Investigations

In digital forensic workflows, **bstrings** is a valuable early-stage tool for:

* **Memory forensics**: Extracting strings from memory dumps (e.g., `memdump.raw`) to identify malicious activity or tools used.
* **Disk image analysis**: Scanning carved files for IOCs like domains, commands, or user info.
* **Triage**: Rapid assessment of large numbers of unknown files across a forensic image.

Because it supports recursive scanning (`--recurse`) and allows filtering by string type, **bstrings** fits well into automated forensic pipelines or analyst toolkits.

**Use Case Example:**
During forensic triage, an analyst might run:

```bash
bstrings /mnt/diskimage/ --recurse --include email,url,ip --json
```

to quickly extract and report all potential IOCs.

## 6. Integration with Other Tools  

## **Advanced Forensic Use of bstrings**

### Combining `bstrings` with `grep` for Filtering

While `bstrings` offers built-in filtering through the `--include` and `--exclude` flags, combining it with UNIX tools like `grep` offers **greater flexibility**—especially in ad-hoc investigations.

For example, an analyst may want to isolate **email addresses** or **suspicious domain names** not caught by a preset:

```bash
bstrings sample.bin | grep -Ei '[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}'
```

This approach enables:

* **Layered filtering**: Extract general strings with `bstrings`, then apply precise regex patterns with `grep`.
* **Post-processing**: Use `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, or `sort` to further parse or analyze output data.
* **IOCs extraction**: Tailor searches for specific malware indicators that may vary from case to case.

---

### Using bstrings with Hex Editors

Hex editors such as **HxD**, **010 Editor**, or **wxHexEditor** allow investigators to inspect the raw byte content of binary files. **bstrings** complements these tools by:

* Identifying strings that **may not be visible in the UI** due to encoding or obfuscation.
* Providing an **offset reference** (with `--print-offset`) to correlate strings found with specific byte locations in a hex editor.

**Workflow Example:**

1. Run `bstrings` with offset printing:

   ```bash
   bstrings malware_sample.bin --print-offset
   ```

2. Open the same file in a hex editor.

3. Jump to the hexadecimal offset from `bstrings` output (e.g., `0x1a3f`) to examine surrounding context.

This combination helps verify if a suspicious string is embedded as plain text, encoded, or obfuscated, and whether it ties to executable code or config blocks.

* HxD and 010 Editor documentation on navigating to offsets

---

### Automating Workflows with Scripts

**bstrings** is highly scriptable and fits well into Python, Bash, or PowerShell workflows commonly used in **digital forensic triage pipelines** or **incident response automation**.

Use cases include:

* **Batch scanning** directories or forensic images for specific string types (e.g., all `.exe` or `.docx` files).
* **Integration with case management tools** (e.g., autogenerating reports with string matches).
* **Creating watchlists**: Comparing extracted strings to known IOC lists.

**Example Bash Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in $(find /evidence -type f -name '*.exe'); do
  echo "Scanning $file"
  bstrings "$file" --include url,email,ip >> /reports/strings_report.txt
done
```

**Python Snippet:**

```python
import subprocess

files = ["suspicious1.exe", "doc_with_macro.docm"]
for f in files:
    print(f"Analyzing {f}")
    result = subprocess.run(["bstrings", f, "--include", "url,email"], capture_output=True)
    with open("output.txt", "ab") as out:
        out.write(result.stdout)
```

## 7. Case Studies and Examples  

## Real-World Scenarios Using `bstrings`

### 1. **Analyzing Suspected Malware Samples**

#### **Scenario**:

An incident response team receives a suspicious Windows executable (EXE) found in a user's Downloads folder. They need to quickly identify if it connects to external domains or uses any specific system paths.

#### **How `bstrings` Helps**:

* `bstrings` extracts **human-readable strings**, categorizes them, and tags them (e.g., `url`, `winpath`, `domain`).
* Analysts can immediately flag **Command and Control (C2)** URLs, IP addresses, or specific registry modifications used by the malware.

#### **Example Output**:

```bash
bstrings suspicious.exe
```

This might return:

```
[winpath] C:\Users\victim\AppData\Roaming\
[url] http://malicious-c2-server.com/update
[domain] update.microsoft.com
[regpath] HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

This allows fast triage without needing to reverse the binary immediately.

---

### 2. **Memory Dump Triage**

#### **Scenario**:

A memory dump is acquired from a compromised system. You want to identify any suspicious strings quickly without full memory analysis in tools like Volatility.

#### **How `bstrings` Helps**:

* Run `bstrings` over the memory dump file (`.raw` or `.dmp`).
* It extracts all readable strings and identifies indicators such as:

  * Hardcoded IPs
  * Webhooks (e.g., Discord URLs)
  * API keys
  * Registry modifications

#### **Command**:

```bash
bstrings memdump.raw -n 6 -o json > strings_output.json
```

Then search:

```bash
cat strings_output.json | jq '.[] | select(.type == "url")'
```

Fast detection of potentially malicious beacons or stolen credentials.

---

### 3. **Incident Response on USB Artifacts**

#### **Scenario**:

A forensic analyst is examining a USB thumb drive found in a physical security audit. They need to identify any executables or documents containing malicious scripts or indicators.

#### **How `bstrings` Helps**:

* Use recursive scanning to process all files.
* Target only binary or Office files.
* Helps identify embedded URLs in Office macros, paths in scripts, or suspicious obfuscation attempts.

#### **Command**:

```bash
bstrings /mnt/usb --recursive --minlength 5
```

Helps extract relevant strings across all artifacts for quick triage and prioritization.

---

### 4. **Correlating Registry Modifications in Persistence Mechanisms**

#### **Scenario**:

You suspect a persistent backdoor is hiding on a system via registry run keys.

#### **How `bstrings` Helps**:

* Filters strings containing `HKCU` or `HKLM`.
* Helps locate potential persistence paths even in compiled binaries or scripts.

#### **Command**:

```bash
bstrings backdoor.exe | grep "HK"
```

Saves time locating specific persistence indicators.

---

### 5. **Triage on Compiled Python Malware (PyInstaller Executables)**

#### **Scenario**:

An EXE made with PyInstaller is suspected of being malware. These are often used to wrap Python scripts into Windows executables.

#### **How `bstrings` Helps**:

* Can detect embedded Python paths, API keys, and hardcoded command URLs.
* Often reveals file paths and configuration info that would be hard to extract otherwise.

Useful for malware targeting Red Team tools, post-exploitation payloads, or stealers.

## Step-by-Step Walkthroughs

---

### Step-by-Step 1: Basic Use on a Suspicious File

**Goal**: Extract categorized strings from a suspicious `.exe`.

```bash
# Step 1: Download or locate the binary
cp /malware/suspect.exe .

# Step 2: Run bstrings with a minimum string length
bstrings suspect.exe -n 6
```

**Explanation**:

* `-n 6`: Only extract strings 6 characters or longer (reduces noise).
* Output shows string + type classification: `[url]`, `[regpath]`, `[email]`, etc.

**Goal**: Use results in scripting or SIEM pipelines.

```bash
bstrings suspect.exe -o json > suspect_strings.json
```

Then use:

```bash
jq '.[] | select(.type == "url")' suspect_strings.json
```

This is especially useful in automation, reporting, or integrating with tools like Splunk or ELK.

### Step-by-Step 3: Recursively Scan a Directory

**Goal**: Forensic triage on many artifacts at once (e.g., USB drive, malware zoo, folder of Office documents).

```bash
bstrings /evidence/malware --recursive -n 5 > all_strings.txt
```

Ensures you catch indicators across file types without needing to analyze each one manually.

### Step-by-Step 4: Combine with `grep` or `jq` for Targeted Analysis

**Example: Extract Only Registry Paths**

```bash
bstrings suspect.exe | grep HKCU
```

Or using JSON:

```bash
bstrings suspect.exe -o json | jq '.[] | select(.type == "regpath")'
```

Quickly isolate key findings, filter noise, and build indicators of compromise (IOCs).

### Step-by-Step 5: Use with `file` or `find` to Narrow Targets

Combine `bstrings` with Linux tools to refine your workflow.

```bash
find . -type f -exec file {} \; | grep "PE32" | cut -d: -f1 | while read f; do bstrings "$f"; done
```

This command searches for Windows PE files only and pipes each into `bstrings`.
