## 1. Introduction to NetworkMiner  

## **Overview of NetworkMiner**

### **What is NetworkMiner?**

**NetworkMiner** is an open-source **Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT)** developed by **Erik Hjelmvik** of Netresec, designed to capture, parse, and analyze packet data in a passive manner. Unlike intrusion detection systems (IDS) or packet crafting tools, NetworkMiner does not generate any network traffic; instead, it is primarily used for post-capture forensic analysis or live packet sniffing.

## 2. Fundamentals of Network Traffic Analysis  

## **Basics of Network Packets and Protocols**

### **What is a Network Packet?**

A **network packet** is the fundamental unit of data that is transmitted over a digital network. When data is sent over the Internet or any IP-based network, it is broken into packets that contain:

1. **Header**: Contains metadata such as source/destination IP addresses, protocol, sequence number, etc.
2. **Payload**: The actual content or data being transmitted.
3. **Trailer**: Often includes checksums or other control information (depending on the protocol).

Each packet is routed independently and can traverse different paths to reach its destination.

> **Source**: [RFC 791 – Internet Protocol (IPv4)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791)

---

### **Common Protocols in Packet Communication**

Protocols define the rules and data formats for communication. Key types include:

* **Transport Layer Protocols**:

  * **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented.
  * **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol): Faster, connectionless, less reliable.

* **Application Layer Protocols**:

  * **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web traffic.
  * **SMTP/IMAP/POP3**: Email.
  * **FTP/SFTP**: File transfer.
  * **DNS**: Domain resolution.
  * **SMB**: Windows file and printer sharing.

* **Network Layer**:

  * **ICMP**: Used by ping/traceroute tools.
  * **IP**: Routing and addressing.

> **Reference**: [RFC 1122 – Requirements for Internet Hosts](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122)

## **Understanding Packet Capture (PCAP) Files**

### **What is a PCAP File?**

**PCAP (Packet Capture)** is a file format used to store network traffic. Tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, or **TShark** can capture and save packet data into PCAP format for later analysis.

Each PCAP file stores:

* Timestamp of each packet.
* Packet length.
* Header and payload contents.
* Interface metadata.

**PCAPNG** is an advanced version (PCAP Next Generation) supporting more metadata and multiple interfaces.

> **Reference**: [PCAP File Format Specification – Wireshark Wiki](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat)

---

### **Why Are PCAP Files Important in Forensics?**

1. **Non-volatile Evidence**: Captures exact copies of packets seen on the wire.
2. **Replayable**: PCAPs can be replayed in tools like Wireshark or Tcpreplay to re-analyze traffic or simulate attack scenarios.
3. **Deep Inspection**: Analysts can dissect payloads, follow TCP streams, extract files or credentials, and trace attack vectors.
4. **Chain of Custody**: With proper handling, PCAPs can be used as legal evidence in court.

## **Role of NetworkMiner in Passive Network Traffic Analysis**

### **What Is Passive Network Traffic Analysis?**

Passive analysis involves **monitoring and analyzing network traffic without altering or injecting packets** into the network. This contrasts with active scanning (e.g., using Nmap or Nessus), which generates traffic and might be detected or disruptive.

In cybersecurity and forensics, passive methods are ideal for:

* **Stealth analysis**.
* **Incident response**.
* **Historical investigation**.

### **NetworkMiner’s Role**

NetworkMiner specializes in **passive traffic analysis** and enables investigators to:

1. **Reconstruct High-Level Artifacts**:

   * Extract transferred **files**, **images**, **videos**, and **documents** from captured traffic.
   * Reconstruct sessions like web browsing or email exchanges.

2. **Credential and Metadata Recovery**:

   * Extract **usernames**, **passwords**, **cookies**, and **tokens** from plaintext sessions.
   * Identify **hostnames**, **operating systems**, and **browser agents**.

3. **Visualize and Map Network Interactions**:

   * Automatically group packets by host and protocol.
   * Visual timeline of session activity, helping with event reconstruction.

4. **No Packet Injection**:

   * Unlike tools such as Wireshark or Bro/Zeek (which support scripting or active data correlation), NetworkMiner simply reads and dissects, ensuring **zero interference** with the network.

5. **Interoperability with PCAP**:

   * NetworkMiner works seamlessly with PCAP files produced by other tools, making it a valuable part of a forensic toolkit alongside Wireshark and Suricata.

## **Conclusion**

Understanding network packets and the structure of PCAP files is critical for any digital forensic analyst or incident responder. NetworkMiner excels in the passive dissection of this data, offering powerful insights into user behavior, security events, and potential intrusions without ever interacting with or altering the target environment.


## 3. User Interface and Navigation  

## **Overview of the NetworkMiner Interface**

NetworkMiner’s interface is designed for **clarity, artifact reconstruction, and host-based forensic investigation**. It provides a **tabbed, host-centric GUI** that groups analyzed network traffic by endpoints (hosts) and artifacts (e.g., files, credentials, messages), which helps investigators navigate large packet captures with ease.

The GUI requires **no command-line interaction** and is especially helpful for digital forensics professionals, incident responders, and malware analysts looking to **extract actionable intelligence** from `.pcap` or `.pcapng` files or live network traffic.

## **Customizing the Interface for Specific Tasks**

Although NetworkMiner is designed to work **out of the box**, its GUI supports some customization and usage optimization:

### **1. Filter Views by Host or Protocol**

* Use **column sorting** and **search boxes** to narrow down hosts based on criteria like:

  * Number of extracted files
  * Number of messages or credentials
  * Specific port usage (e.g., only view SMB traffic)

### **2. Toggling Tabs Based on Workflow**

* Focus on tabs relevant to your **investigative goals**:

  * **Malware analysis** → Files + Hosts tabs
  * **Credential compromise** → Messages tab
  * **Exfiltration or C2** → DNS + Hosts + Files tabs

### **3. Exporting Artifacts**

* Export **all extracted files**, **host summaries**, or **PCAP slices** to work with external tools like:

  * VirusTotal
  * Autopsy or FTK
  * Python scripts for IOC extraction

### **4. Adjusting File Storage Directory**

* You can configure the output folder in settings to redirect extracted artifacts to a **forensic evidence volume** or **SIEM ingestion directory**.

### **5. Using with PCAP Filters**

* Pre-process large PCAPs using tools like `tcpdump`, `editcap`, or `mergecap` to **split or filter traffic** before importing into NetworkMiner for better performance.
