# Splunk Tutorial Outline

## 1. Introduction to Splunk

## **What is Splunk?**

### **Overview of Splunk as a Data Analysis and Monitoring Tool**

**Splunk** is a proprietary software platform used for **searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data** via a web-style interface. It is most commonly used to collect, index, and analyze log data in real time from various sources like applications, systems, and devices.

* It enables organizations to gain operational intelligence from machine data.
* It can handle **structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data**.
* Originally developed for log analysis, Splunk has grown into a comprehensive platform for **data analytics, security information and event management (SIEM), and observability**.

### **Use Cases**

Splunk is widely adopted across multiple domains:

#### **1. IT Operations**

* Helps monitor system performance, detect outages, and diagnose root causes of problems.
* Provides real-time dashboards for **network, server, and application performance**.

#### **2. Security (SIEM)**

* Splunk Enterprise Security is used for threat detection, compliance, and incident response.
* Enables **correlation searches, alerts, and dashboards** for security teams.

#### **3. Business Analytics**

* Enables insights into **customer behavior, marketing performance**, and transaction patterns by analyzing logs and event data from web applications.

#### **4. DevOps/Observability**

* Used with Splunk Observability Suite to **monitor infrastructure, APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**, and troubleshoot issues in CI/CD pipelines.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Data Ingestion, Indexing, and Searching**

* **Data Ingestion**: Splunk ingests data from various sources including logs, syslogs, metrics, APIs, and third-party services.
* **Indexing**: Once data is ingested, it is parsed and indexed to allow efficient search.
* **Searching**: Splunk uses **SPL (Search Processing Language)** to search and analyze the indexed data.

Example SPL query:

```spl
index=web_logs status=500 | stats count by source
```

### **2. Dashboards and Visualizations**

* Users can build **real-time dashboards** with panels showing charts, graphs, tables, etc.
* Visualizations help track **KPIs, anomalies, and trends**.
* Includes support for **custom visualizations using JavaScript or D3.js**.

### **3. Alerts and Reporting**

* **Alerts** can be triggered based on search results, thresholds, or anomalies.
* Alerts can be configured to trigger actions like sending an email, running a script, or creating a ticket in ServiceNow.
* **Reports** are scheduled searches that can be emailed, exported, or saved for auditing.

## **Splunk Architecture**

### **Components**

Splunk has a **distributed architecture**, especially in enterprise environments. The key components are:

#### **1. Universal Forwarder (UF)**

* A lightweight agent installed on source machines.
* Forwards raw data to the Indexer without parsing it.
* Minimal resource usage.

- [Splunk UF Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/latest/Forwarder/Abouttheuniversalforwarder)

#### **2. Indexer**

* Responsible for **receiving, parsing, indexing, and storing** data.
* Handles search requests and returns relevant results to the Search Head.
* Can be clustered for high availability and scalability.

- [Splunk Docs - Indexing](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Aboutindexing)

#### **3. Search Head**

* Provides the **user interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data**.
* Processes search requests and distributes them to one or more indexers.
* Can be part of a **Search Head Cluster** for horizontal scalability.

- [Search Head Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DistSearch/Aboutdistributedsearch)

---

### **Data Flow in Splunk**

The general flow of data is as follows:

1. **Data Source**: Application logs, OS logs, network traffic, etc.
2. **Universal Forwarder**: Collects data and forwards it.
3. **Indexer**: Parses, indexes, and stores data.
4. **Search Head**: Executes searches and generates dashboards/reports for users.

In larger deployments, the architecture may also include:

* **Heavy Forwarders**: Can parse and filter data before sending to indexers.
* **Deployment Server**: Manages configurations for forwarders.
* **License Master** and **Cluster Master**: Manage licensing and clustered environments.

## 2. Installing Splunk
---

### **System Requirements**

Before installing Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Free, itâ€™s essential to ensure your system meets the official requirements for optimal performance.

#### **Supported Operating Systems**

Splunk supports a range of platforms:

* **Linux (Preferred for production deployments)**

  * RHEL/CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, Amazon Linux, etc.
* **Windows**

  * Windows 10, 11, Server 2016/2019/2022 (64-bit only)
* **macOS**

  * Only for **development or testing**. Not recommended for production.

- [Splunk Platform Requirements](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements)

---

#### **Hardware Requirements**

These vary based on the size and scale of deployment (small test vs. production), but the **general recommendations** are:

| Component | Minimum (Small/Test) | Recommended (Production)  |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **CPU**   | 2 cores              | 12 cores+                 |
| **RAM**   | 4 GB                 | 12â€“16 GB+                 |
| **Disk**  | 20 GB                | SSDs preferred, 800 IOPS+ |

Splunk requires **fast disk I/O** since it's data-intensive. SSDs are highly recommended for indexers.

---

#### **Software Requirements**

* **Python**: Splunk ships with its own Python runtime.
* **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (JavaScript enabled).
* **Firewall/SELinux**: May need configuration to allow port `8000` (Splunk Web) and others.

---

### **Installation Steps**

Splunk is available in two major editions:

* **Splunk Enterprise**: Full-featured, supports clustering, premium apps.
* **Splunk Free**: Same core engine as Enterprise, but limited to one user and lacks advanced features.

### **Steps to Add Data (GUI-based)**

1. Go to **Settings > Add Data**.
2. Choose a data source:

   * **Upload** (for one-time files)
   * **Monitor** (for real-time log folders or ports)
   * **Forward** (for data from Universal Forwarders)
3. Select or create an **input type** and define:

   * Source Type (e.g., `syslog`, `apache:access`)
   * Index (e.g., `main`, `web_logs`)
   * Host identifier
4. Review and submit the configuration.

### **Verifying Data Ingestion**

After adding data:

* Go to **Search & Reporting**
* Use a basic query:

  ```spl
  index=* | head 10
  ```
* You should see ingested events displayed in the search UI.
* Use filters like `source`, `sourcetype`, and `host` to validate specifics.

---

## **Understanding Splunk's Data Pipeline**

Splunk processes data through a **multi-stage pipeline**, which is essential to understand how raw logs turn into searchable events.

---

### **1. Data Input Phase**

* Splunk **collects raw data** from files, ports, scripts, etc.
* Forwarders (especially **Universal Forwarders**) often deliver this data to Indexers.

---

### **2. Parsing Phase**

* Splunk **breaks the data into events** based on timestamps and line breaks.
* **Line merging**, **timestamp extraction**, and **event boundaries** are determined.
* This occurs primarily on **Heavy Forwarders or Indexers**.

---

### **3. Indexing Phase**

* Parsed events are transformed into **indexed segments**.
* Data is stored in compressed files across directories called **buckets** (hot, warm, cold, frozen).
* Metadata like index name, source, sourcetype, and timestamp is added.

---

### **4. Searching Phase**

* When users run queries in the **Search Head**, the request is distributed to the appropriate **Indexers**.
* Results are returned and can be formatted using **commands**, **statistics**, and **visualizations**.
