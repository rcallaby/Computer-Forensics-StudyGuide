### **3. Disk Imaging Workflow**
- **Objective:** Learn the step-by-step process of disk imaging.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Preparing for imaging: Documentation and securing the evidence.
  - Write-blockers: Hardware and software write protection.
  - Imaging process:
    - Acquiring hash values (MD5, SHA1) before imaging.
    - Creating a bit-by-bit copy.
    - Verifying the image integrity after acquisition.
  - Storing and securing images.

- **Practical Lab:**
